# niu_helper
A Surge script to check NIU scooter's battery level and mileage data.

## WARNING: Use At Your Own Risk
I haven't tested the script yet cause I don't have a NIU scooter.

## Usage
1. Get your SN from the app.
2. Get the token by MITM attack the app's traffic.
3. Fill your SN and token in the niu.js file.
4. Add the script to your Surge configuration.
